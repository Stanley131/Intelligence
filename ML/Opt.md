### Optimiztion
  - There are three kinds of optimization algorithms:
      - Optimization algorithm that is not iterative and simply solves for one point.
      - Optimization algorithm that is iterative in nature and converges to acceptable 
        solution regardless of the parameters initialization such as gradient descent applied 
        to logistic regression.
      - Optimization algorithm that is iterative in nature and applied to a set of problems that 
        have non-convex cost functions such as neural networks. Therefore, parametersâ€™ initialization
        plays a critical role in speeding up convergence and achieving lower error rates.
