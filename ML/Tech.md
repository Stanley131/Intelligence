### What is a Synthetic dataset?
  - As the name suggests, quite obviously, a synthetic dataset
    is a repository of data that is generated programmatically. 
    So, it is not collected by any real-life survey or experiment. 
    Its main purpose, therefore, is to be flexible and rich enough 
    to help an ML practitioner conduct fascinating experiments with 
    various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.  
 - The number of features and length of the dataset should be arbitrary.
 - It can be numerical, binary, or categorical (ordinal or non-ordinal)
 - It should preferably be random and the user should be able to choose a
   wide variety of statistical distribution to base this data upon i.e. 
   the underlying random process can be precisely controlled and tuned,
