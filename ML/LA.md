### Matrix operation 
  - A diagonal matrix is a square n 􏰒 n matrix whose nondiagonal entries are zero. 
  - A (Bx)  = (AB)x
  - A(BC)  =  (AB)C
  - AB not equal BA, AB = AC does not mean A = C 
  - (AT)T = A 
  - (A + B)^T = A^T + B ^T 
  - (AB)^T = B^T * A^T
### Invertible 
  - CA = I and AC = I 
  - detA = ad - bc
  - matrix A is invertible if and only if detA not equal to 0.
  - If A is an invertible nxn matrix,thenforeachbinR ,Ax = b has the unique solution x D A􏰐1b.
  - (A)-1)-1 = A 
  - (A-1)^T * A^T= (A * A^-1)^T = I 
  - Invertible Linear Transformations: S(T(x)) = x; T(S(x)) = x 
### Column Space and Null Space of a Matrix 
  - The column space of a matrix A is the set Col A of all linear combinations of the columns 
    of A.
  - The null space of a matrix A is the set Nul A of all solutions of the homogeneous 
    equation Ax D 0.
  - A basis for a subspace H of Rn is a linearly independent set in H that spans H.
