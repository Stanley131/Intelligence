  - Probabilite: Knowing paramtres → prediction of outcomes
  - Likelihood: Observation of data → estimation of parameters
  - Prior probability, in Bayesian statistical inference, is the probability 
    of an event before new data is collected. 
  - That revised probability becomes the posterior probability and is 
    calculated using Bayes' theorem.
  - Maximum likelihood estimation is a method that will find the values of μ
    and σ that result in the curve that best fits the data.
  -  Maximum likelihood estimation is a method that will find the values of         parameters to best expain the data. 
 ### Gaussian Distribution
